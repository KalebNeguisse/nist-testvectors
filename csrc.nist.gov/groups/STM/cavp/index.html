              <li><a href="notices.html">[09-05-13]</a> -- On July 19,2013, NIST announced the approval of Federal   Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-4, the Digital Signature Standard.    All of the changes between FIPS 186-3 and FIPS186-4 had already been   incorporated into the CAVP testing tool; the testing of FIPS186-3   implementations is identical to the testing of FIPS 186-4 implementations. There   is no need for a transition period in which both FIPS 186-3 and FIPS 186-4   validation would be performed. Previous CAVP validations for FIPS 186-3 will be   considered as equivalent to those for FIPS 186-4. Vendors should start using   FIPS 186-4 immediately.

        <h1>Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)</h1>
        
        <p>The <strong>Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)</strong> 
          encompasses validation testing for FIPS approved and NIST recommended 
          cryptographic algorithms and components of algorithms. Cryptographic 
          algorithm validation is a prerequisite to the Cryptographic Module Validation 
          Program (CMVP). The CAVP was established by NIST and the Communications 
          Security Establishment (CSE) in July 1995. All of the tests 
          under the CAVP are handled by third-party laboratories that are accredited 
          as Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories by the National 
          Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Vendors interested 
          in validation testing of their algorithm implementation may select any 
          of the accredited laboratories.</p>
        
        <h1>Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Specifications</h1>
        <p>Below are the algorithms for which the CAVP currently has validation testing. 
        Each section consists of links to the cryptographic algorithm standard, 
        the algorithm validation test suite specifications (the Validation System 
        document), the algorithm validation list, and the test vectors to informally 
        verify the correctness of an algorithm implementation. <BR>

        <h3>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple-DES, and Skipjack Algorithms</h3>
        
        <p>Currently, there exist three FIPS-approved symmetric key algorithms 
          for encryption: Advanced Encryption Standard (<strong>AES</strong>), 
          <strong>Triple-DES</strong>, and <strong>Skipjack</strong>. <em>AES

        <h4>Testing Requirements:</h4>
        
        <p>Validation testing for AES, Triple-DES, and Skipjack algorithms are handled 
        by the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program's (<a href="../cavp/index.html">CAVP</a>) 
        <a href="../testing_labs/index.html">CST labs</a>.</p>
         
        <ul class="bullets1">
          <li> AES tests are described in <a href="documents/aes/AESAVS.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">The 
            Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm Validation Suite (AESAVS)</a>. </li>
          
          <li> Triple-DES tests are described in NIST Special Publication <a href="../../../publications/nistpubs/800-20/800-20.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">800-20</a>, 
            <em>Modes of Operation Validation System for the Triple Data Encryption 
            Algorithm (TMOVS): Requirements and Procedures</em>. An additional 
            test, the <a href="documents/des/DESMMT.pdf" class="pdf">Multi-block Message Text 
            (MMT)</a>, is also required. </li>
            
          <li> <strong>Additional testing note:</strong> The AES and TDES Counter 
            Mode requires additional prerequisite testing of the underlying symmetric 
            algorithm using any mode of operation that utilizes the forward cipher function. </li>
            
          <li> Skipjack tests:  As of January 2011, the CAVP only validates Skipjack decryption implementations.
	      Please see <a href="../../../publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">SP800-131A Transitions: Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths</a> for more information.
	     <br />&nbsp;<br />
         The Skipjack tests for the decrypt state are described in NIST Special Publication <a href="../../../publications/nistpubs/800-17/800-17.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">800-17</a>, <em>Modes of Operation Validation System (MOVS): Requirements and Procedures</em>. The validation test suite for Skipjack implementations using the decrypt state consists 
            of the Modes test for the Decryption Process, the Variable Ciphertext Known Answer Test and the Variable Key Known Answer Test for the Decryption Process.  Based on the Skipjack modes of operation implemented, SP800-17 Section 5 
	    indicates the tests required to validate an implementation of the Skipjack Algorithm.
       <br />&nbsp;<br />  
	   (NIST Special Publication 800-17 erroneously states the Initial Permutation 
            KAT for the Decryption Process is also required for Skipjack validation. 
            This is not true.) </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Validation List:</h4>
        
        <p>NIST maintains validation lists for <a href="documents/aes/aesval.html" target="_blank">AES</a>,

        <h4>Test Vectors:</h4>
        <p>The following files provide electronic versions of the vectors for 
          the Known Answer Test (KAT), and sample values for the Monte Carlo(MCT) 
          test, and the Multiblock Message (MMT) test. These values are properly 
          formatted in response (.rsp) files. Vendor response files should match 
          this format exactly. </p>
        
        <p>In addition, a file with intermediate results (.txt) for the Monte 
          Carlo test is supplied. The Monte Carlo tests consist of 400 cases. 
          For each case, initial values are provided, and 10,000 iterations of 
          the desired mode of operation are run. The output of each iteration 
          is used as input to the next iteration. To aid debugging, we provide 
          the output for each of the first five (5) iterations of the 10,000 as 
          well as the final (10,000th) output. The intermediate values are indented 
          by one tab and clearly identified by use of the word &quot;Intermediate&quot;.</p>
        
        <p>These vectors can be used to informally verify the correctness of an 
          AES and/or TDES algorithm implementation. The validation system documents 
          (see above) describe the details of the tests. </p>
        
        <p><strong>NOTE, use of these vectors does not take the place of validation obtained through the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).</strong> </p>

        <h3>FIPS 186-4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS) (DSA, RSA, and ECDSA algorithms)</h3>
 
 		<p>On July 19, 2013, NIST announced the approval of Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-4, the Digital Signature Standard.&nbsp; All of the changes between FIPS 186-3 and  FIPS186-4 had already been incorporated into the CAVP testing tool; the testing  of FIPS186-3 implementations is identical to the testing of FIPS 186-4  implementations. There is no need for a transition period in which both FIPS  186-3 and FIPS 186-4 validation would be performed. Previous CAVP validations  for FIPS 186-3 will be considered as equivalent to those for FIPS 186-4.  Vendors should start using FIPS 186-4 immediately.        </p>
 		<p>The FIPS specifies three techniques for the 
          generation and verification of digital signatures: </p>
          
        <ul class="bullets1">
          <li> <strong>Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),</strong> </li>
          <li> <strong>RSA (as specified in ANSI X9.31 (RSA)), </strong>and </li>
          <li> <strong>Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA; as specified in ANSI X9.62).</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>FIPS 186-4 allows the use of any random number generator (RNG) or random 
          bit generator (RBG) that is approved for use in FIPS 140-validated modules, 
          subject to the transition schedule specified in SP 800-131A. Specific 
          references to SP 800-90 should not be considered as a requirement to 
          use a generator specified in SP 800-90 until such time as the use of 
          the other generators is no longer allowed.</p>
        
        <p>Copies of the <strong>ANSI X9.31</strong> and <strong>ANSI X9.62</strong> 
          standards are available from <a href="http://www.x9.org/" target="_top">X9</a>, a standards committee accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). NIST 
          does NOT have copies of these standards available for distribution.
          
        <p>All three digital signature techniques in FIPS 186-4 make use of the 
          Secure Hash Algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4 dated March 2012, <em>Secure 
          Hash Standard (SHS)</em> accessible via the hashing section of this

          RSA algorithm implementations of the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, as specified 
          in <em>Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography

          testing to assure the encoded message EM and the intermediate integer 
          IR are in the correct formats. This testing verifies that an implementation 
          under test (IUT) does not contain a potential implementation design 
          that could introduce a vulnerability in these algorithms. This testing 
          has been added to the Signature Verification validation test described 
          in the RSAVS document. No modification to this document was necessary 
          to add this feature. Below in the Test Vectors section, there are test 
          vectors available to informally test if this vulnerability exists in 
          an implementation.</p>
          
        <p>For all validated cryptographic modules that incorporate RSA, the CAVP 
          and CMVP strongly suggest re-testing of the RSA algorithmic implementations

        <p>If new CAVP testing is performed and the vulnerability is determined 
          not to be present, the CSTL can submit the new test results to the CAVP 
          along with a letter indicating that the implementation passed the RSA 
          testing in CAVS5.2 and the vulnerability is not present. The letter 
          should request that a new algorithm certificate be printed to replace 
          the already issued certificate referencing the new version of CAVS. 
          Please indicate the already issued certificate number. This letter should 
          be included in the zip file along with the other files. Note that the 
          certificate number will not change. Only the reference to the version 
          of the CAVS tool and the signatory date will be changed. (Note the validation 
          request will be submitted using already established procedures.)</p>
        
        <p>If CAVP testing is performed and the vulnerability is discovered, the 
          following revalidation process shall be followed:</p>
        
        <ul class="bullets1">
          <li> The algorithm implementation is changed to remove the vulnerability 
            resulting in a different version number, </li>
          <li> Submit the new test results to the CAVP for the new version of the 
            implementation. A new algorithm certificate will be issued for the 
            new version of the implementation. The certificate will reference 
            CAVS5.2. </li>

        <p><strong>Additional testing note:</strong> For the RSA functions, all

        Key Wrapping  and Authenticated Encryption and Decryption (KW, KWP and TKW)</h3>
        
        <p><a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-38F.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">NIST  SP 800-38F</a>, &ldquo;Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for  Key Wrapping&rdquo; (December 2012), describes cryptographic methods that are  approved for &ldquo;key wrapping,&rdquo; i.e., the protection of the confidentiality and  integrity of cryptographic keys. In addition to describing existing methods,  this publication specifies two new, deterministic authenticated-encryption modes  of operation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm: the AES Key  Wrap (KW) mode and the AES Key Wrap With Padding (KWP) mode. An analogous mode  with the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) as the underlying block  cipher, called TKW, is also specified, to support legacy applications.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing Requirements:</h3>
        <p>CST labs can test for conformance to the KW, KWP and TKW algorithms in Special Publication 800-38F. The testing requirements for this algorithm can be found in the document titled <a href="documents/mac/KWVS.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">The Key Wrap Validation System (KWVS)</a>. Additional testing note: The KW and KWP validation process requires additional prerequisite testing of the underlying NIST-Approved 128 bit symmetric key algorithm.  Currently, the only 128 bit symmetric key algorithm approved by NIST is AES.  The TWK validation process requires addition prerequisite testing of the underlying TDEA symmetric key algorithm.
        Please note that authenticated encryption (AE) with KW, KWP and TKW may use either the forward or inverse cipher function (e.g., KW-AE with AES-128 inverse cipher function).  Authenticated decryption (AD) algorithms (KW-AD, KWP-AD and TKW-AD) may also use either the forward or inverse cipher function.  Therefore, the prerequisite testing must exercise the corresponding forward or inverse cipher function in one of the fundamental modes of operation in NIST SP 800-38A. </p> 
        
        <h3>Validation List:</h3>
        <p>NIST maintains the current KW, KWP and TKW Validations. KW and KWP Validations are included on the validation list of its approved symmetric key block cipher whose block size is 128 bits-- therefore it is included on the <a href="documents/aes/aesval.html" target="_blank">AES Validation List</a>.  TKW validations are included on the <a href="documents/des/tripledesval.html" target="_blank">TDES validation list</a>. </p>

        <h2>Algorithm Component Validation Testing </h2>
        
        <p>Beginning in 2011, the CAVP offers the validation of algorithm components. 
          There exists an increased need for the testing of individual components 
          of approved algorithms. Some examples of situations where algorithm 
          component testing will be required includes PIV Smartcard applications, 
          where there are processing limitations, and situations where parts of 
          special publications can be used with components outside the special 
          publication. The components for which we have validation testing are 
          listed below.</p>

        <h2>Retired Validation Testing</h2>
        
        <h3>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</h3>
        
        <p>FIPS 46-3, Data Encryption Standard (DES), was withdrawn May 19, 2005 
          because the cryptographic algorithm no longer provided the security that 
          is needed to protect Federal government information. DES is no longer 
          an Approved algorithm. The DES Algorithm Validation Webpage is still 
          accessible via the Validations List webpage, for historical purposes 
          only.</p>
        
        <h3>Data (Message) Authentication Code (MAC) and Key Management Using 
          ANSI X9.17</h3>
        
        <p>The automated conformance tests for FIPS 113 and 171 are no longer 
          operational. Currently, if a FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 cryptographic 
          module implements either of these two standards, the <a href="../testing_labs/index.html">CST 
          testing laboratories</a> perform some testing that these FIPS requirements 
          are implemented correctly in the cryptographic module.</p>
        
        <h3>Message Authentication Code (MAC), FIPS 113</h3>
        <p>The MAC Validation System (MVS) tested for compliance with <a href="../../../publications/fips/fips113/fips113.html" target="_blank">FIPS 113</a>, Computer Data Authentication. A list of <a href="documents/des/mvsval.htm" target="_blank">validated

        <h3>Key Management Using ANSI X9.17, FIPS 171</h3>
        <p>The Key Management Validation System (KMVS) tested for compliance with 
        FIPS 171, Key Management Using ANSI X9.17. A list of <a href="documents/des/kmvsval.htm">validated 
        products</a> is maintained by the Security Technology Group.</p> <br/>
